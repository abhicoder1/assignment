    "Ans- In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program's regular flow is interrupted, and the interpreter searches for an appropriate exception handling mechanism to deal with the situation. This allows you to gracefully handle unexpected errors and prevent your program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as when trying to perform an invalid operation on data, accessing a non-existent file, dividing by zero, etc. Python provides a mechanism to catch and handle exceptions using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Nature of Occurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions occur during the runtime of the program when unexpected situations or errors are encountered.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed. They occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Timing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Occurs during the runtime of the program, while the program is executing.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Detected before the program starts running, during the parsing phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. This allows you to gracefully recover from errors and continue executing the program.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Since syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, they must be fixed in the code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Examples include division by zero (ZeroDivisionError), trying to access a non-existent dictionary key (KeyError), or attempting to open a non-existent file (FileNotFoundError).\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Error: Examples include misspelled keywords, missing colons in control structures, unmatched parentheses, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Precedence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks to control the program's behavior in case of errors.\n",
    "Syntax Error: Must be fixed before the program can be executed; you can't handle syntax errors during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that can be caught and handled using try-except blocks to prevent program crashes. On the other hand, syntax errors are detected before program execution and must be fixed in the code before running the program."

    "Ans- When an exception is not handled in a program, it leads to an abrupt termination of the program's normal execution. The unhandled exception causes the program to display an error message traceback, which includes information about the exception type, the line of code where the exception occurred, and the call stack leading up to the exception.
