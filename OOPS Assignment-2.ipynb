    "Ans- Data abstraction can be achieved in Python (or any other object-oriented programming language) by using classes and defining appropriate access levels for attributes and methods. Data abstraction involves hiding the internal implementation details of an object and exposing only the relevant data and functionalities through a well-defined interface.\n",

    "\n",
    "Public: No access modifier is used, and attributes/methods are accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected: Use a single underscore _ before the attribute/method name, indicating that they are intended for internal use or subclass access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private: Use double underscore __ before the attribute/method name, making them private and not directly accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Expose Relevant Functionalities: Provide public methods in the class that allow users to interact with the object. These methods should manipulate the internal data and perform operations without exposing the underlying implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Hide Implementation Details: Keep the internal attributes and implementation details private or protected, preventing direct access and modification from external code. This ensures that changes to the internal representation do not affect the external code using the class."
